ENIGMA_CLIENT(1)                                                ENIGMA_CLIENT(1)


NAME
        enigma-client.py  -  client for a distributed attack on a message


SYNOPSIS  
        enigma-client.py [-r] host port


DESCRIPTION
        enigma-client.py repeatedly connects to an enigma key server to
        try to get a ciphertext and a range of keys. It then launches
        enigma to work on the range. Once the job is done, the results
        are submitted to the server.

        enigma-client.py should run forever and at the lowest priority.

        Log output is written to stderr.


OPTIONS
        -r     Append enigma's output to the file "results"
               in the run directory.


IMPORTANT NOTE
        enigma-client has to use the same log-ngram dictionaries as
        the server. ONLY use the official 00trigr.cur and 00bigr.cur
        dictionaries.
