Version 0.76.2
18 July 2006

  winaux.py, install.py:
                When using a localized version of Windows, previous version
                did not detect membership of group "Administrators". Fixed.


Version 0.76.1
14 July 2006

  install.py:   Previous version tried to use domain controller even
                when logged in as local user. Fixed.


Version 0.76
8 July 2006

  eclient-rpc.py:
                New XML-RPC client. The client is an alternative for
                the existing client.

  enigma-client.py:
                Improved file locking with flock(). Sets default timeout
                for sockets.

  install.py:   New install script guides through the installation process.


  uninstall.py: Helps with uninstall.


Version 0.75
28 March 2006

  hillclimb.c, cipher.c:
                From now on only unique scrambler states are tested.
                The -a, -x options (and the default) have a different
                meaning now. mr_mode is supplanted by sw_mode.

  enigma.c, key.c:
                Simulator: Defaults for M4 UKW changed to B-THIN/Beta.

  enigma-client.py:
                All log output goes to stderr. Added -r switch that
                causes enigma to write output to the file "results".
                Added ability to download new dictionaries automatically.

                Suggestions came from (alphabetical order, sorry if I
                forget anyone):

                Ian Flanigan, Steve Hosgood, A.S., Geoff Sullivan.  


Version 0.73.3
27 February 2006

  conf-cc:      -O3 generally leads to better performance.
                Reported by Jeff Gilchrist.

  INSTALL.txt:  Users should change "nominal" to a random password in
                eclient-XP-Home-install.bat or eclient-XP-Pro-install.bat.
                Reported by Jamyn.


Version 0.73.2
19 February 2006

  hillclimb.c, enigma-client.py:
                Set thread priority to THREAD_PRIORITY_IDLE.
                Reported by Jeff Gilchrist.

  enigma-client.py:
                Fixed wrong treatment of return value of os.system().
                (Luckily the script worked even with the wrong treatment.)


Version 0.73.1
10 February 2006

  enigma.1, enigma.txt:
                Fixed bug in explanation of 00hc.resume format.


Version 0.73
20 January 2006

  enigma.c:     Removed bug so that -o and -R options can actually be used
                together.

  hillclimb.c:  State is now saved periodically to allow for
                non-graceful shutdown when enigma.exe is being
                run as a Windows service. (Graceful shutdown
                relied on SIGTERM.) 

                Status messages are displayed when enigma runs in resume mode.

  enigma-client.py:
                Added check for existence of enigma.exe.
                Added status messages.
                Removed lockfile mechanism.

  INSTALL.txt:  Added detailed install instructions for enigma-client.



Version 0.71
7 January 2006

  hillclimb.c:  Removed calls of free() and fprintf() from signal handler.
                New version has longer shutdown time on SIGTERM. Worst case
                is around 0.1 s on a Pentium 400MHz with a ciphertext length
                of 250 letters.

  ic.c:         Replaced instances of 250 with CT.

  enigma-client.py:
                Changed class name to Eclient.
                Switched to 00trigr.naval/00bigr.naval

  dict/ :       Added new naval statistics compiled from original
                M4 messages.
